# [FB](/README.md) Documentation

### This is the documentation for Frostbyte, and will be updated as the project progresses.

### The primary focus of the documentation lays in the [structure](structure/README.md) directory. This directory will contain documentation for unreleased features, and is mainly for management. Documentation from the structure directory may be migrated into the main documentation in the future.
