# Frostbyte documentation

This is the documentation for Frostbyte, and will be updated as the project progresses.

Currently, the documentation is very sparse, but you can find the structure documentation in the `structure/` directory. That will contain documentation for unreleased features, for the time being. This is mainly for management, but may be migrated into the main documentation in the future.
