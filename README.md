## When will Frostbyte be released?

Frostbyte is currently in heavy development - it is in a pre-alpha state, and is not yet ready for public use. You should expect a release a beta version of Frostbyte in the near future, and a full release much later. Frostbyte is currently being developed and designed by myself, [NebulaDev](https://github.com/nebula-developer. I am not spesifically looking for contributors, but contributions and testers are welcome.
