# Structure documentation

This is the structure documentation for Frostbyte. All unreleased features are first documented here, and then moved into the main documentation when they are released. If you would like to add a feature to Frostbyte, please first modify the documentation blueprint ([here](blueprint.md)), and then add the feature to the code. If you would like to add a feature to Frostbyte, but do not know how to implement it, please contact me at [nebuladev.contact@gmail.com](mailto:nebuladev.contact@gmail.com).
